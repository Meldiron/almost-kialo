		Almost Kialo is a social platform where you can ask <b>ANYTHING</b>! Others can express
		themselves by either agreeing or disagreeing with you. Pick a side based on constructive
		comments that describe their reasoning. Don't worry about unmeaningful hate! Each comment
		creates a separate discussion that can be commented on too! A comment that no one agrees with is
		pushed down the list and becomes irrelevant.
